This section will have a collection of both free and paid books that can help you learn Object Pascal and the Lazarus IDE.

When a book is listed as creative commons or is public domain and redistribution of the book is authorised a copy will be added to the website to avoid any potential broken download links in the future. A link to the original authors website will always be provided when available.

When redistribution of a free book is not allowed a link will be made to the original source.

If there is a zip download or source code repository for the books code examples a link will be included.

## Potentially Free Book

I say potentially free because Embarcadero the company behind Delphi have been giving away Marco's book for free from their website for several years. 

To get a free copy of this book you have to give your contact details to Embarcadero. This book is written by one of the most respected Delphi authors writing books on Delphi since the 90s so it's well worth it. I don't get spam from them so they honour any unsubscribe requests I may have made.

By getting the book free from this source the author should hopefully be paid in some way by Embarcadero. I'm not sure what deal they have with the books author.
