Free Pascal and Lazarus programming is a huge topic with many people specialising in different areas of development and have a strong understanding of the things they use in their own projects. As a result it makes sense for people with strong knowledge to contribute what they know for the benefit of the entire community.

Free Pascal, Lazarus and Delphi are all great programming environments and can allow you to be extreamly productive and create great things but unfortunately it can be difficult for new people to get started due to a lack of getting started user friendly tutorials and intermediate training to get up and running quickly.

The goal of {{ site.title }} is to create this content so that we have the same getting started learning materials of the mainstream popular programming languages and attract new users to Free Pascal, Lazarus and Delphi programming environments.

By making it as easy as possible to contribute I hope that as this site grows it will become the go to place for adding user friendly getting started tutorials and more indepth training for Free Pascal and Lazarus development.

The entire source code is available on github at [{{ site.git_address }}]({{ site.git_address }}) and the website is in the docs directory and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website.

{{ site.title }} has a custom Github Actions Workflow that builds Jekyll and does not use the older and restricted Github Pages Jekyll. This allows us to use the latest version of Jekyll and run any Jekyll Plugin without issues.

You can fork the {{ site.title }} github repository at [{{ site.git_address }}]({{ site.git_address }}) make changes on your repository and make a pull request to submit the changes back.

Information contributed to the github repository will be licensed under the {{ site.license }}.

Any third party content such as book downloads and book image covers, book example code etc will be used under the license the original owners distributed their work as because their work is being redistributed by us and not our creation.

Any third party embedded videos from places like YouTube will ideally be embedded with the consent of the content creator and the content creator will continue to own the copyright and distribute their content as they see fit.

As a general rule any content you add to {{ site.title }} that is not existing content being redistributed under the original authors license will be added to {{ site.title }} under the {{ site.license }}.

If you create a new section of content as a tutorial series then you can add your name as the author of that training series and other people can can contribute changes as needed to make things clearer or fix any potential issues that are found.
