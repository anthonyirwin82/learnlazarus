Free Pascal, Lazarus and Delphi are all great programming environments and can allow you to be extreamly productive and create great things but unfortunately it can be difficult for new people to get started due to a lack of getting started user friendly tutorials and intermediate training to get up and running quickly.

The goal of {{ site.title }} is to create this content so that we have the same getting started learning materials of the mainstream popular programming languages and attract new users to Free Pascal, Lazarus and Delphi programming environments.

By making it as easy as possible to contribute I hope that as this site grows it will become the go to place for adding user friendly getting started tutorials and more indepth training for Free Pascal and Lazarus development.

The entire source code is available on github at [{{ site.git_address }}]({{ site.git_address }}) and the website is in the docs directory and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website.
